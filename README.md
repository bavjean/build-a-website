# Cloning a Website

For this project my goal was to take a mock up of a website, and try to clone is as closely as possible using HTML and CSS. I also added breakpoints to add responsiveness if it were to be viewed on a tablet or mobile device.

## Getting Started

2. Navigate to html and css files

### Prerequisites
